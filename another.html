    <h1>Hit Another Player's Ball...or think you did?</h1>
    <div class="ruling">
      <p>If you mistakenly hit a ball that isn't yours, you will have to take a two strong penalty.</p>

      <p>Strokes made when hiting the wrong ball do not count in your score. </p>

      <p>If you have hit the wrong ball, try and find it's owner (hopefully on the course nearby). They will need to place a ball back in the original spot.</p>

      <p>This is why it's super important to always know what ball you're hiting and mark it carefully!</p>
