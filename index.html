      <p id='text'>As a lover of all things green and outdoors I knew that it wouldn't be long before golf captured my heart. My goal is to help you enjoy your time out on the course. Out-of-bounds and lost golf balls happen. Here's to feeling prepared and great rounds.</p>
      Have fun out there.
